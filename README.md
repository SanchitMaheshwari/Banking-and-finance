Overview of the ProjectVITyarthi is a simple, menu-driven console application developed in Python to simulate basic banking operations and financial calculations. It allows users to input their personal details and then select from various banking services, including Savings Accounts, Recurring Deposits (RD), Fixed Deposits (FD), and Loans. The application processes the user's input (principal, time, age, etc.) and calculates the interest, final maturity amount, or total payable loan amount.This project was developed as a college assignment to demonstrate proficiency in:Input/Output handling.Conditional logic (if/elif/else).Looping (while loop for validation and transactions).Basic financial calculations.
FeaturesCustomer Data Capture: Collects essential customer details (Name, Age, Gender, Mobile No., Address).Mobile Number Validation: Includes a basic while loop to validate that the mobile number entered is approximately 10 digits long.Savings Account Simulation: Calculates Simple Interest ( I = (P*R*T)/100) and allows the principal amount P to be increased or decreased through simulated in-term transactions.Fixed Deposit (FD) Logic: Calculates Simple Interest with a dynamic interest rate R based on both the Principal amount and the Customer's Age (offering higher rates for Senior Citizens, Age>60.Recurring Deposit (RD) Logic: Calculates Compound Interest (CI = P*(1 + R/100)^T -P) where the interest rate R varies based on the principal amount.Loan Service: Calculates Simple Interest, the total payable amount, and the estimated monthly installment for three loan types (Property, Education, Business), each assigned a different base interest rate.Detailed Output: Prints a summary of customer details and the final financial outcome (interest earned/paid, final amount/total payment).
